## Project Overview

**MoveMint-Ledger** is the operational and financial ledger system for MoveMint. This repository serves as the single source of truth for tracking movements, transactions, and financial records within the MoveMint ecosystem.

---

## Scope

This project encompasses:

- **Ledger API** – Core endpoints for creating, reading, and managing ledger entries
- **Landing Page** – Public-facing interface at `/movemint`
- **CI/CD Pipeline** – Automated testing, building, and deployment workflows
- **Documentation** – Project guides, templates, and operational standards

---

## Goals

1. **Reliability** – Ensure the ledger system operates consistently and handles errors gracefully
2. **Transparency** – Maintain clear documentation and audit trails for all transactions
3. **Developer Experience** – Provide standardized templates, clear contribution guidelines, and automated CI/CD
4. **Scalability** – Build a foundation that supports future growth and feature additions

---

## Key Outcomes

- [ ] Fully operational ledger API at the `/api/ledger` route (relative to app base URL)
- [ ] Landing page accessible at the `/movemint` route (relative to app base URL)
- [ ] CI pipeline that runs tests, linting, and smoke tests on every push/PR
- [ ] Standardized issue and PR templates for consistent contributions
- [ ] Clear documentation for onboarding developers and collaborators

---

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Core API** – Implement remaining ledger endpoints as needed
2. **Enhance Testing** – Add unit and integration tests for all critical paths
3. **Deploy to Production** – Set up production environment and deployment workflow
4. **Monitor & Iterate** – Establish monitoring and feedback loops for continuous improvement
