# OPS_PROJECT - Movemint-Ledger

## Vision

Movemint-Ledger is a foundational financial ledger system designed to provide transparent, reliable, and modular transaction tracking for modern applications. The project aims to establish a "Studio Standard" for how financial data flows through distributed systems.

## Project Scope

### Core Objectives

1. **Transaction Integrity** - Ensure all ledger entries are immutable and verifiable
2. **API-First Design** - Expose all functionality through well-documented REST endpoints
3. **Modular Architecture** - Support pluggable backends and extensible middleware
4. **Developer Experience** - Provide clear documentation, templates, and contribution workflows

### Key Components

| Component | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| `/api/ledger` | Core ledger API endpoint | Planned |
| `/movemint` | Landing page and dashboard | Planned |
| CI/CD Pipeline | Automated testing and deployment | Active |
| Documentation | OPS_PROJECT and contribution guides | Active |

## Studio Standard v1

The Studio Standard establishes conventions for:

- **Code Quality**: Linting, testing, and review processes
- **Collaboration**: Issue templates, PR workflows, and branch naming
- **Deployment**: Smoke tests and automated validation
- **Documentation**: Consistent markdown formatting and project structure

## Stakeholders

- **Maintainers**: Core team responsible for reviewing PRs and managing releases
- **Contributors**: Community members adding features, fixes, and documentation
- **Integrators**: Developers building applications on top of Movemint-Ledger

## Contribution Workflow

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from `main`
3. Submit a pull request using the PR template
4. Pass all CI checks (lint, test, smoke)
5. Request review from maintainers
